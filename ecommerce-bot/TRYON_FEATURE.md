# Virtual Try-On Feature

## Overview
Added virtual try-on capabilities to the MCP server, allowing users to see how clothing items would look on them using AI-powered image generation.

## New Tools Added

### 1. `virtual_tryon`
Processes a virtual try-on request with user's photo and product image.

**Parameters:**
- `user_id` (string, required): The unique identifier of the user
- `user_image_url` (string, required): URL of the user's photo (full body or upper body preferred)
- `product_id` (string, required): The product ID to try on
- `product_image_url` (string, optional): Direct URL of the product image. If not provided, will look up product.

**Example Usage:**
```python
result = await client.session.call_tool("virtual_tryon", {
    "user_id": "+1234567890",
    "user_image_url": "https://storage.example.com/user-photos/user123.jpg",
    "product_id": "PROD002"
})
```

### 2. `get_tryon_tips`
Returns helpful tips for getting the best virtual try-on results.

**Parameters:** None

**Example Usage:**
```python
result = await client.session.call_tool("get_tryon_tips", {})
```

## How It Works

1. **User sends photo and selects product**
   - Via WhatsApp: "I want to try on the white shirt [attached photo]"
   - The system extracts the image URL and product reference

2. **MCP Server processes request**
   - Validates the product ID
   - Retrieves product image URL if not provided
   - Calls TryOnService with both images

3. **TryOn Service generates result**
   - Uses Google Gemini API for AI-powered image generation
   - Creates realistic composite showing user wearing the product
   - Uploads result to Azure Blob Storage

4. **User receives result**
   - Gets URL to view the generated try-on image
   - Receives suggestions for next steps (save, share, add to cart)

## Natural Language Examples

Users can request try-ons in various ways:

- "I want to try on the white shirt"
- "Show me how PROD003 would look on me"
- "Can I see the denim jacket on me? [photo attached]"
- "Virtual try-on for the blue dress please"
- "Try this shirt on me" (with product and user images)

## Mock Product Catalog

Currently configured with mock products for testing:
- `PROD002`: White Formal Shirt
- `PROD003`: Blue Summer Dress
- `PROD004`: Denim Jacket
- `PROD005`: Black T-Shirt

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **Google Gemini API**: For AI-powered virtual try-on generation
- **Azure Blob Storage**: For storing user photos and try-on results
- **TryOnService**: Handles the try-on processing logic

### Key Features
- Asynchronous processing for better performance
- Error handling for invalid products or failed generation
- Result storage in user's personal folder
- Base64 encoding for backward compatibility

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=your_azure_connection
AZURE_TRYON_RESULTS_CONTAINER=tryon-results
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the try-on functionality:
```bash
python test_tryon_mcp.py
```

This will:
1. Connect to the MCP server
2. List available tools
3. Get try-on tips
4. Simulate a virtual try-on
5. Test natural language processing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Product Database Integration**
   - Connect to actual product catalog
   - Fetch real product images dynamically

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Multiple angle views
   - Size recommendations based on fit
   - Outfit combinations (multiple items)
   - AR preview for real-time try-on

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement async job queue
   - Add caching for frequently requested items
   - Batch processing for multiple items

4. **User Experience**
   - Progress indicators during generation
   - Comparison view for multiple items
   - Save favorite try-ons
   - Share on social media integration
