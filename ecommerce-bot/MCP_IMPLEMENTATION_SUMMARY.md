# MCP Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for the E-commerce WhatsApp Bot system.

## Key Changes

### 1. MCP Server (mcp_server.py)
- Converted from a class-based structure to a standalone FastMCP server
- All methods converted to `@mcp.tool()` decorated functions
- Returns strings instead of dictionaries for MCP compatibility
- Runs with STDIO transport via `mcp.run(transport='stdio')`

### 2. MCP Client (mcp_client.py)
- Converted to standalone pattern following the MCP SDK tutorial
- Direct STDIO connection to MCP server using `ClientSession` and `stdio_client`
- Removed dependency on server_manager abstraction
- Added `connect_to_server()` method for establishing MCP connection
- Implements async context manager for proper resource cleanup
- Tool calls now go directly through `session.call_tool()`

### 3. Client Pool (client_pool.py)
- Updated to work with standalone MCP clients
- Removed StdioServerManager dependency
- Each client connects to MCP server independently
- Proper cleanup of MCP connections on pool closure

### 4. Architecture Changes

#### Before:
```
Webhook → ClientPool → MCPClient → ServerManager → MCPServer
```

#### After:
```
Webhook → ClientPool → MCPClient ←(STDIO)→ MCPServer
```

## How It Works

1. **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`):
   - Runs as a standalone process
   - Exposes e-commerce tools via MCP protocol
   - Communicates over STDIO (stdin/stdout)

2. **MCP Client** (`mcp_client.py`):
   - Spawns MCP server as a subprocess
   - Establishes STDIO connection
   - Discovers available tools dynamically
   - Executes tools via JSON-RPC over STDIO

3. **Integration**:
   - WhatsApp webhook uses ClientPool
   - ClientPool manages MCPClient instances
   - Each MCPClient connects to MCP server independently
   - LLM service generates tool calls based on discovered tools

## Usage

### Running the MCP Server Standalone:
```bash
python server/mcp_server.py
```

### Using MCP Client:
```python
from client.mcp_client import MCPClient
from services.redis.redis_service_enhanced import EnhancedRedisService

# Create client
redis_service = EnhancedRedisService()
client = MCPClient(
    user_id="user123",
    session_manager=redis_service,
    llm_client=None,
    server_manager=None
)

# Connect to server
await client.connect_to_server()

# Process message
response = await client.process_message("Show me laptops under $1000")

# Disconnect
await client.disconnect()
```

### Using with Context Manager:
```python
async with client:
    response = await client.process_message("Add item to cart")
```

## Testing

Test scripts available:
- `test_standalone_mcp.py` - Tests standalone MCP client connection
- `test_mcp_connection.py` - Tests client pool with MCP integration

## Benefits

1. **Standards Compliance**: Follows MCP protocol specification
2. **Decoupling**: Client and server are properly decoupled
3. **Tool Discovery**: Dynamic tool discovery at runtime
4. **Scalability**: Each client has independent server connection
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for multiple MCP servers
2. Connection pooling for MCP server processes
3. Enhanced error handling and retry logic
4. Metrics and monitoring for MCP connections
5. Support for other MCP transports (HTTP, WebSocket)
